## New Wheelz (aka Skate Sharez)

Skate Sharez is a site for sharing recommendations of places to skateboard/longboard. 
Skaters can browse all the locations by state or explore the area around them by looking for 
markers on a map.

Users can share locations they've found, supplying not only an address but characteristics of a spot. Additionally, users can comment on a location to describe their experience there.

[See the deployed application on Heroku](https://skate-sharez.herokuapp.com/)
